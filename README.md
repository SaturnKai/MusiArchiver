# Musi Archiver

Since the recent removal of Musi off of the App Store, preserving your music has became increasingly more important. With no needed queue times or fees, this extension allows you to import your library directly into YouTube (and YouTube Music), or download them as an archive file. As of now, this extension is **only available** for chromium based browsers.
